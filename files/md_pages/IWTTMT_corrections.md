# Mathematical Errors:

## Chapter 1: Irrationality

### Section 1.3: Rational approximations
* (Page 9) The intervals in the proof of the Dirichlet approximation theorem should be $\{ [\frac{j-1}{N}, \frac{j}{N}) \}_{j = 1, \ldots, N}$.
* (Page 9) "Taking $N$ as small as possible" should read as "Taking $N = q$".

## Chapter 4: Transfinite induction

### Section 4.4: Order types
* (Page 80) In figure 4.1, the purple semi-infinite chain (far right) is incorrectly drawn. All arrows in the purple chain should be reversed, yielding a chain with an end and no beginning.

## Chapter 6: Approximation by polynomials

### Section 6.5: Is there a useable polynomial approximation method?
* (Page 135) The non-analytic function $\psi(x)$ is defined by $\psi(x) = e^{-1/x} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{x > 0}$, not $\psi(x) = e^{-x} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{x > 0}$ as written.

## Chapter 7: Public-key cryptography

### Section 7.4: RSA
* (Page 155) In the caption of figure 7.2, we have described a Cook reduction of B to A, not A to B as written. If an efficient algorithm for A can be used to build an efficient algorithm for B, we have reduced B to A.
