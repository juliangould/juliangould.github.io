# Mathematical Errors:

## Chapter 1: Irrationality

### Section 1.3: Rational Approximations

* (Page 9) The intervals in the proof of the Dirichlet approximation theorem should be $\{ [\frac{j-1}{N}, \frac{j}{N}) \}_{j = 1, \ldots, N}$.
* (Page 9) "Taking $N$ as small as possible" should read as "Taking $N = q$".
* (Page 80) In figure 4.1, the purple semi-infinite chain is incorrectly drawn. All arrows in the purple chain should be reversed.





# Typographical Errors:
* (Page 7) Missing parentheses for $f(\frac{p}{q})$ in the rational roots theorem.
