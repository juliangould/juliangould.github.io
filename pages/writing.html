        <h4>Preventing a flash war: Countering the risk of AI-driven escalation on the battlefield</h4>
        <p class="authors">Kyle Brown, Julian Gould, Jesse Hamilton</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                This post on the Penn Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law blog, coauthored with Lieutenant Colonel Kyle Brown and Professor 
                Jesse Hamilton, draws a parallel between the 2010 Flash 
                Crash in financial markets and the emerging risks of escalation in AI-enabled warfare. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We argue that human oversight 
                alone may be insufficient to prevent rapid, unpredictable escalation and propose battlefield “circuit breakers” as a 
                regulatory safeguard. Drawing on lessons from finance and national security strategy, the piece outlines how the United 
                States could lead in developing international mechanisms to prevent unintended AI-driven conflict.

        <h4>Nicotine Supplementation and Thesis Writing</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould </p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                This essay recounts my self-experiment of using nicotine lozenges to overcome motivational 
                paralysis while writing my PhD thesis. Demoralized after restarting research late in 
                graduate school, I struggled to write despite my desire to finish my degree.  I devised a regimen linking nicotine 
                intake exclusively to thesis work, drawing 
                on a half-remembered study about nicotine and habit formation. 
                My results were striking: productivity surged, emotional resistance waned, and withdrawal proved trivial. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In retrospect, there were methodological flaws, and I have some ethical qualms about sharing this piece of writing.
                However, I believe that nicotine supplementation greatly improved my capacity for sustained focused labor, and I would not have
                completed my dissertation without it. I simply had to share.

        <h4>Proofs as Rhetoric</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                In <em>Proofs as Rhetoric</em>, I argue that mathematical proofs, as we write and communicate them, 
                are not purely formal deductions but acts of persuasion—rhetorical constructions aimed at convincing an 
                audience that a result is true. Drawing on classical rhetorical concepts like <em>logos</em>, <em>ethos</em>, and 
                <em>pathos</em>, I explore how proofs depend not only on logical soundness, but also on the credibility of the author 
                and the emotional resonance of the argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                These ideas have practical consequences for both research and teaching. In research, 
                we must tailor our proofs to the expectations and norms of different mathematical communities. In the 
                classroom, recognizing the rhetorical nature of student proofs changes how we assess clarity, style, and 
                understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I advocate for a broader recognition of rhetoric as a central component of mathematical practice 
                and pedagogy.

        <h4> Customary International Humanitarian Law and Greedy Algorithms (WIP)</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
            Rule 14 of Customary International Humanitarian Law aims to strike a 
            balance between minimizing harm to civilian lives and infrastructure and permitting military operations in or near civilian 
            areas. In practice, this often resembles a greedy algorithm: each individual attack must, in expectation, 
            yield greater military advantage than civilian harm.
            </p>

            <p>
            But greedy algorithms are, by nature, short-sighted. They fail to account for path dependencies and are prone to 
            getting stuck in locally—but not globally—optimal outcomes. This essay, written in reflection on the 
            <em>Ethical and Legal Dilemmas of Autonomous Weapons in War and National Security</em> 
            conference, explores the limitations of proportionality as framed by Rule 14, the role of path dependency, and how 
            these issues intersect with AI-driven decision-making. The piece concludes with some proposed alternatives to Rule 14.

        <h4>Moral Mereology</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                In mathematics, local-to-global (L2G) and global-to-local (G2L) principles are powerful 
                results concerning structures and their constituent parts. At heart, an L2G principle asserts 
                that if a structure can be decomposed into pieces, and each piece satisfies a certain property, 
                then the whole structure does as well. Conversely, a G2L principle states that if the entire structure satisfies a 
                property, then each of its parts must too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many contentious issues in moral and political philosophy can be fruitfully analyzed through the lens of 
                L2G and G2L reasoning. This essay explores several such examples—including distributional justice, plural obligations, 
                the slogan "ACAB," mosaic theory in intelligence analysis, and institutional racism. I argue that a 
                unifying theory theory of local-to-global and global-to-local principles in ethics is needed to clarify 
                the relationships among these seemingly disparate debates.

        <h4>A Dialogue on a Classic Interview Puzzle</h4>

        <p class="description">
            <p>
                A mathematical dialogue that revisits a well-known envelope puzzle, probing the assumptions 
                behind a strategy that seems to beat random guessing. What begins as a clever probabilistic trick 
                unravels under scrutiny, touching on free will, canonical null-set structures, and the purpose of 
                "real-world framing" in math puzzles.

        <h4>Stop Having Opinions</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                Social media and mass media have radically expanded not just the range of acceptable opinions (the Overton Window), 
                but also the number of topics on which we're expected to have a view. Call it the <em>Overton Breadth</em>. 
                We're expected to have opinions on everything from housing policy to international trade deals to local school 
                board decisions halfway across the country. If you don't have an opinion on these matters, it's interpreted as a 
                character flaw.
            </p>

            <p>
                This essay explores how the pressure to opine on every issue leads to social tension, cognitive overload, 
                and worse policy outcomes. It's a case for epistemic humility; we should recognize our limitations to deeply understand
                and analyze all of the issues du jour. Most of us are wrong about most things. Why pretend otherwise?

        <h4>Are we fit to SAIL?</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                The University of Pennsylvania is replacing traditional calculus lectures with 
                “SAIL”—Structured Active In-class Learning. It's a flipped classroom model that, in theory, 
                maximizes engagement and improves learning outcomes. I don't dispute the theory. But I'm skeptical it will work in 
                practice. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This essay explores three structural obstacles to successful SAIL implementation: 
                <em>free rider problems</em> (students relying on others to do the prep work), 
                <em>unstable equilibria</em> (once the course slides into lecture mode it doesn't come back), 
                and <em>principal-agent problems</em> (instructor incentives are not aligned with student learning outcomes). 
                Taken together, these form a kind of pedagogical Bermuda Triangle. Some SAIL classes will thrive. Most, 
                I suspect, will sink into being lectures in disguise.

        <h4>Induction and Co-Induction</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>s
                This is a write-up of a talk I gave for the Penn Undergraduate Mathematics Society in Spring 2023. 
                It starts with a familiar idea—induction on the natural numbers—and slowly generalizes it until the concept almost 
                disappears. Along the way, we recast induction in terms of <em>initial algebras</em>, define what it means to do 
                induction on structures like lists, and explain how these ideas show up (covertly) in many parts of mathematics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then we enter "co world" and turn the arrows around. The second half of the essay explores the dual 
                notion of <em>coinduction</em> via <em>coalgebras</em>, where the focus shifts from construction to 
                observation. We discuss black box systems, terminal coalgebras, and <em>stream differential equations</em>—a 
                coinductive framework for reasoning about infinite sequences.

        <h4>The Continuum Hypothesis is True in Practice</h4>
        <p class="authors">Julian Gould</p>
        <p class="description">
            <p>
                Most mathematicians know the standard story: the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) was the first major open question in set 
                theory, placed at the top of Hilbert's famous list in 1900, and ultimately shown to be independent of the ZFC axioms. 
                Is it true? Is it false? Dealer's choice. While historically correct, the standard story is incomplete (as so many tales
                involving Gödel are). For nearly a century, numerous mathematicians believed CH was true and 
                tried to prove it. One of the most ambitious efforts was the so-called <em>Perfect Set Program</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This essay traces the mathematical and historical arc of the Perfect Set Program–a failed attempt to prove CH by 
                showing that every uncountable subset of the reals contains a perfect subset. While it failed to prove CH, of course,
                it led to beautiful results and a fascinating partial truth: in most natural settings, uncountable sets of reals do 
                contain perfect subsets. CH may be independent of set theory, but the program left us with the conclusion that
                it's “true in practice.”
