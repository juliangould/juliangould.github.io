            <h4>Lebesgue's Theory of Integration (Forthcoming)</h4>
            <p class="context">Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics, October 2025</p>
            <p class="description">
                 Lebesgue's motivation for developing his integral wasn't abstraction for its own sake.
                 As mathematicians began to understand how messy subsets of the continuum can be, the limitations 
                 of Riemann's theory became impossible to ignore. 
            </p>
            <p class="description">    
                 This talk traces the development of the integral 
                 from Eudoxus to Lebesgue, highlighting the specific, concrete problems Lebesgue set out to solve. We also 
                 take a critical look at how this material is presented in the standard real analysis curriculum today.

            <h4>Probabilistic Discourse Sheaves</h4>
            <p class="context">AMS Fall Eastern Sectional Meeting, October 2024</p>
            <p class="description">
                How do opinions—especially uncertain or probabilistic ones—spread and stabilize in a network?
                Discourse sheaves offer a mathematical framework for modeling this process, where each agent's opinion
                is represented as a vector or function. This talk extends core results on discourse sheaves to settings
                where opinions live in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                In particular, we examine the case where opinions are valued in the space of
                finite-variance random variables, allowing us to handle probabilistic beliefs. We show that when opinions
                are shared via bounded linear maps, consensus still emerges. Finally, we explore an approach to nonlinear
                opinion sharing—such as communicating variances or standard deviations—that opens a path toward more expressive
                models of belief.

            <h4>Type Theory for Topologists</h4>
            <p class="context">Cornell Topology Festival, May 2023</p>
            <p class="description">
                In the 1970s, Per Martin-Löf introduced a system of dependent type theory as a constructive foundation
                for mathematics. Unexpectedly, this system gives rise to a new kind of foundation—one where the most basic
                mathematical objects are not sets, but homotopy types of spaces.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This talk offers an informal introduction to Martin-Löf's type theory, with a focus on its topological
                interpretations. We'll conclude by exploring the univalence axiom, which (roughly speaking) says that two
                types are equal if and only if they are structurally equivalent.

            <h4>Mathematics in the Third Reich</h4>
            <p class="context">Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics, February 2022</p>
            <p class="description">
                The founding of the Weimar Republic at the end of World War I opened the doors of German academic mathematics
                to Jewish scholars. The rise of the Nazi regime in the 1930s closed them more tightly than ever before.
                What happened inside German math departments under the Third Reich? How did political ideology shape the
                teaching, research, and professional structure of mathematics?
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                In this talk, we'll begin by examining the anatomy of mathematics academia—its institutions, gatekeeping mechanisms,
                and cultural norms. We'll then trace how these structures were reshaped under Nazi rule, with an emphasis on how
                politics and ideology permeated the mathematical profession. This episode in history raises urgent questions about how 
                mathematics can be politicized—and how those pressures
                might still echo today.

            <h4>The Not-So-Random Graph</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Student Lunch Seminar, Fall 2024</p>
            <p class="description">

                Consider the following experiment: take a pair of natural numbers and flip a fair coin. 
                If the coin lands heads, connect the pair with an edge; if tails, do nothing. Repeat this for every distinct pair. 
                What kind of graph emerges from this process? What structural properties might it have? Wanna bet on it?
                </p>

                <p>
                This talk begins with a betting game. For any graph property you name, I'll tell you the exact probability 
                that the resulting countable random graph satisfies it. If I'm right, you donate your wager to charity. 
                Remember: the house always wins.

                <p>
                In the second half of the talk, I'll reveal how I managed to win every single bet. The secret involves one of my 
                favorite theorems in all of mathematics.

            <h4>IRS Table 2000CM</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Student Lunch Seminar, Fall 2023</p>
            <p class="description">
                <p>
                 Internal Revenue Service Table 2000CM is a statistical triumph. Table 2000CM uses the enormous dataset collected in 
                 the 2000 US census to answer a single morbid question: given a population of 100,000 Americans born at the same time, 
                 how many do we expect to die each year? Unfortunately, the answer is pretty grim. After an initial spike for infant 
                 mortality, the year-by-year chance of dying grows exponentially, approximately doubling every eight years. Aging is 
                 central to mortality risk. 
                </p>
                <p>
                 In this talk, we will contemplate our own mortality and examine Table 2000CM. We will use 
                 2000CM to shed light on various models of aging, why the body is not like a car, and why we should be 
                 skeptical of treating illness as a mechanism for increasing human longevity. Despite the macabre content, 
                 I promise we will end on a happy note.

            <h4>Perfect Sets and the Continuum Hypothesis</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Student Logic Seminar, Fall 2023</p>
            <p class="description">
                <p>
                The Continuum Hypothesis was the first deep problem in cardinal arithmetic. In short, it asks whether every 
                uncountable subset of the real numbers has the same cardinality as the full continuum. Though we now know the 
                hypothesis is independent of the standard axioms of set theory, it inspired many failed proof attempts.
                </p>

                <p>
                This talk explores one such attempt, often called the “Perfect Set Program.” Since perfect sets are known to have 
                the cardinality of the continuum, the idea was simple: prove that every uncountable set of reals contains a perfect 
                subset. While this strategy ultimately couldn't succeed, it led to remarkable partial results. Mathematicians 
                discovered that many rich and natural families of uncountable sets do, in fact, contain perfect subsets.

            <h4>Induction and Coinduction</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Undergraduate Math Society, Winter 2023</p>
            <p class="description">
                <p>
                Everyone is familiar with defining and proving things by induction. With a little thought, you might realize that 
                inductive reasoning can be applied to structures beyond just the natural numbers. This talk begins by exploring a 
                general perspective on induction through the language of <em>algebras</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                In mathematics, there's a familiar trick: sometimes we “turn all the arrows around” and attach a “co-” prefix to every 
                noun. But what happens when we do this to induction? What are the <em>co</em>-natural numbers? The second part of the talk 
                introduces the basics of <em>co-algebra</em> and shows how it can be used to model the behavior of “black box” systems. 
                We'll conclude by discussing <em>stream differential equations</em> as a concrete example of how co-algebraic thinking 
                can simplify mathematical argumentation.

            <h4>So You Think You Know ℝ</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Student Lunch Seminar, Fall 2022</p>
            <p class="description">
                <p>
                In an undergraduate mathematics education, what object gets the most attention? For most students, 
                I'd wager it's the real numbers. When someone says “number,” they usually mean “real number.” The reals are the 
                foundation of calculus. In algebra, they're examples of a group (in two ways), a ring, and a field. In linear algebra, 
                they're the default field over which vector spaces are defined. They're constructed and scrutinized in analysis, 
                and the geometry of the reals motivates the entire subject of manifold theory. In nearly every area of math, 
                the real numbers are a go-to example of an “extremely basic example.”
                </p>

                <p>
                With all this attention, surely we all have a deep and nuanced understanding of the real numbers. Let's put that to 
                the test. In this talk, audience members will compete for fabulous prizes (including Amazon gift cards) by 
                demonstrating their superior knowledge of the real numbers. Who will be crowned <strong>The Realest</strong>? Who will be 
                exposed as a faker? Throw your hat in the ring and prove yourself.

            <h4>Why Homotopy Theorists Should Care About Homotopy Type Theory</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Geometry/Topology Seminar, Fall 2022</p>
            <p class="description">
                While Homotopy Type Theory has generated much buzz from logicians, computer scientists, 
                and cranks on the internet, many pure homotopy theorists remain uninterested. In this talk, I attempt to 
                change this (at least on a small scale within Penn) by making a philosophical case for why homotopy theorists 
                should care about HoTT.

            <h4>Models of Dependent Type Theory, I and II</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Student Logic Seminar, Fall 2022</p>
            <p class="description">
                In set-theoretic foundations, models are taken to be sets (in some meta-set theory). In type theoretic foundations,
                the categorical semantics are a little more complicated. In the first talk, we discuss the syntactic category of a
                dependent type theory. This category, which directly translates types and substitutions into objects and morphisms,
                forms the most basic model of a dependent type theory. Type constructors naturally correspond to categorical constructions.
                Next, we discuss functorial semantics, where a model is a functor from the syntactic category to some other suitable category.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second talk, we discuss why functorial semantics have fallen out of fashion, and more contemporary 
                notions of models such as display map categories, categories with families, and comprehension categories.

            <p class="description">
                <p>
                In his <em>Esquisse d'un Programme</em>, Grothendieck expressed a desire for a new set of "tame" topological foundations that 
                would better accommodate stratified spaces defined using attaching maps satisfying certain regularity conditions.
                The o-minimal structures of model theory are the leading contender for tame foundations today.
                </p>

                <p>
                The first talk introduces ideas from first-order model theory, such as models, compactness, categoricity, and decidability.
                Special attention is paid to quantifier elimination and the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem for semi-algebraic sets. The second
                talk introduces o-minimality and discusses how o-minimal structures can serve as a suitable framework for "tame" (or definable)
                algebraic topology. We conclude with some new results from tame homotopy theory.

            <h4>Infinite Ethics</h4>
            <p class="context">Penn Graduate Student Lunch Seminar, Fall 2020</p>
            <p class="description">
                <p>
                Aggregative Consequentialism describes a broad class of ethical frameworks, including the most familiar forms of 
                utilitarianism. Even today, many philosophers and thinkers continue to advocate for such theories.
                But these frameworks, at least in their standard form, rely on implicit assumptions about physics and cosmology. 
                In particular, if we allow for a universe with infinitely many morally considerable beings, 
                aggregative consequentialism begins to break down.
                </p>

                <p>
                Can these theories be revised to remain coherent in an infinite universe? In this talk, I'll explore several 
                proposed adaptations and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Along the way, we'll encounter some fascinating 
                mathematical tools, such as ultrafilters and ordered over-fields of the real numbers.

                Dirty secret: the financial services industry often hides simple ideas behind layers of jargon, making people think 
                they can't handle their own finances. I've spent a couple of years in the industry, and I'm here to cut through the noise 
                and share some practical basics that might help you get started investing.

                In this talk, we'll cover the essentials: how markets work, what mutual funds and ETFs are, how to open a 
                brokerage account, how to think about credit cards, buying a home, and when to pay off debt. Content will be tailored
                toward the financial situation of graduate students, so no 401(k) talk. Come for the free lunch, stay for your financial 
                future.
