      <h4>I Wish They'd Taught Me That</h4>
      <p class="description">
        A book of playful and rigorous mathematics for curious mathematicians, co-authored with Robin Pemantle. 
        It explores a variety of topics in mathematics that are not part of the standard undergraduate curriculum, but really ought to be.
        Each chapter is written in a conversational tone, but is nearly rigorous in its exposition. A secondary purpose for this work is to be
        a sourcebook of potential projects for directed reading programs. In my experience as a DRP mentor, it can be very frustrating when a
        student has no clue what they would like to spend the semester studying. Part of the difficulty is the ever-present problem of
        "unknown unknowns." Students often don't even know what they <em>could</em> spend the semester learning about! This book seeks to remedy
        this problem for other DRP mentors by providing a variety of potential projects, complete with vetted sources.

      <h4>Restaurants Dehyped (WIP)</h4>
      <p class="description">
        Mediocre restaurants in trendy neighborhoods have been a consistent source of disappointment in my life. Restaurants Dehyped is my
        attempt at a solution for the Philadelphia area through machine learning. By disentangling <em>experiential attributes</em> 
        (food quality, service, ambiance, etc.)
        from <em>context attributes</em> (location, price, trendy neighborhoods, etc.), we provide a normalized <bf>experience score</bf>
        that evaluates the quality of a dining experience of a restaurant, independent of the context of a restaurant.

      <p>Data is pulled from Google reviews, the US census, and SEPTA. </p>

      <h4>Sitcom Sounds</h4>
      <p class="description">
        In a sitcom, it's common for a sound effect to play when a character enters a room. A love interest gets a "whoo", a child 
        gets an "aww", and every character on <em>Seinfeld</em> gets a bass riff. This project creates the same sonic structure for your
        own apartment door. Each person you choose (as identified by their phone) gets their own custom "entrance" music that plays when
        they enter your door.
