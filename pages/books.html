      <h4>I Wish They'd Taught Me That</h4>
      <p class="description">
        A book of playful and rigorous mathematics for curious mathematicians, co-authored with Robin Pemantle. 
        It explores a variety of topics in mathematics that are not part of the standard undergraduate curriculum, but really ought to be.
        Each chapter is written in a conversational tone, but is nearly rigorous in its exposition. A secondary purpose for this work is to be
        a sourcebook of potential projects for directed reading programs. In my experience as a DRP mentor, it can be very frustrating when a
        student has no clue what they would like to spend the semester studying. Part of the difficulty is the ever-present problem of
        "unknown unknowns." Students often don't even know what they <em>could</em> spend the semester learning about! This book seeks to remedy
        this problem for other DRP mentors by providing a variety of potential projects, complete with vetted sources.
